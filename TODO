TODO List - Honeytrap Improvement Ideas

1. Update and maintain the codebase to ensure compatibility with the latest software versions and resolve obsolete functionalities causing errors (e.g., NFQ and IPQ listening modes).
2. Enhance the htm_dnsDetection module to enable the detection of DNS responses in intercepted network packets, improving the understanding of intercepted DNS communication within network traffic.
3. Expand functionality by incorporating modules for the STMP and MySQL protocols, as their associated ports are currently ignored in the configuration file.
4. Improve the codebase for SSH, SFTP, and SCP protocols to enhance their functionality within the application.
5. Implement a more efficient handling mechanism for incoming events when receiving TCP connections and packets within the same connection. This modification is crucial for the proper functioning of the application.
Please note that this is a TODO list outlining proposed improvements and additions to the open-source Honeytrap application.
